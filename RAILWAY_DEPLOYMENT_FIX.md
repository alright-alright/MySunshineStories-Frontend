# Railway Frontend Deployment Fix

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **package.json Scripts**: Added proper `start` script for production
2. **Dependencies**: All required packages are included
3. **Vite Configuration**: Proper host and port settings
4. **Alternative Server**: Added Express server option for better production performance

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Using Vite Preview (Default)
The `npm run start` command uses Vite's built-in preview server:
```json
"start": "vite preview --port ${PORT:-4173} --host 0.0.0.0"
```

### Option 2: Using Express Server (Recommended for Production)
If you want better production performance, update Railway's start command to:
```
npm run start:express
```

## Railway Configuration

### Environment Variables (Required)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://luciantales-production.up.railway.app
```

### Build & Start Commands
Railway should auto-detect these, but you can manually set:
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run start` (or `npm run start:express` for better performance)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
```bash
cd /tmp/LucianTales-Frontend
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

2. **In Railway Dashboard**:
- Go to your frontend service
- Check the deployment logs
- Verify the build succeeds
- Check that start command runs

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment still fails:

1. **Clear Build Cache**:
   - Settings → Advanced → Clear Build Cache
   - Trigger new deployment

2. **Check Logs for Specific Errors**:
   - Look for "npm ERR!" messages
   - Check if PORT environment variable is being set

3. **Manual Override** (if needed):
   In Railway settings, manually set:
   - **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npx vite preview --port $PORT --host 0.0.0.0`

## Expected Successful Output

Build phase should show:
```
✓ XX modules transformed
dist/index.html
dist/assets/...
✓ built in X.XXs
```

Start phase should show:
```
Preview server running at:
- Local: http://localhost:XXXX/
- Network: http://0.0.0.0:XXXX/
```

## Testing Locally

To test the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
PORT=3000 npm run start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Summary

The main fixes were:
- ✅ Added proper `start` script in package.json
- ✅ Configured Vite to accept PORT environment variable
- ✅ Set host to 0.0.0.0 for Railway compatibility
- ✅ Added all necessary dependencies

Your deployment should now work!
